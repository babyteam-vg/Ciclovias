  - Great job on the bike lane! Now that we're face to face, we can really talk.
  - I have dream, dear {player}. So much traffic has polluted the air of this beautiful
    city too much.
  - I want to make this city a paradise for cyclists to reduce pollution from exhaust
    pipes.
  - Do you think you can help me with that? I'm sure you can.
