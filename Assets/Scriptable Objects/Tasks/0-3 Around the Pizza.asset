  - "Hi honey, I'm Mar\xEDa Magdalena Giorgina, founder of the famous Mama Gio's
    pizzas. But you can just call me Mama Gio."
  - Let me tell you, you did a spectacular job with that bike lane you built downtown.
    We're delivering more than ever!
  - That's why, my dear, I have an important request to make. It's very difficult
    for us to bring the ingredients intact and on time here.
  - Could you build a safe bike lane for my boys from the Pizzeria to the Market,
    please?
  context: Build a safe bike lane from Mama Gio's Pizzeria to the Market so that
    the pizzeria can supply itself with ingredients.

  - Oh, you're a real treasure, my love. The mayor was right about you; you know
    how to meet the needs of the elderly!
  - Now that we have a steady stream of ingredients, we'll be hands-down the best
    pizzeria in town. Thank you very much, sweetheart.
  - Next time you stop by the pizzeria, come in for something to eat, it's on me!
