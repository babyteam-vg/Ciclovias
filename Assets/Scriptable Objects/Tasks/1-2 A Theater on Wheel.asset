  - A pleasure to meet the newest member of the city's public officials. As Culture
    Minister, I manage the Theater.
  - There will be a play soon, sponsored by the Municipality, to promote bike transportation.
  - 'Therefore, I have a task for you: a charming, but safe, bike lane from the Theater
    to the Bike Store.'
  - What could be better than buying a bike after a play, don't you agree?
  - What do you mean you don't?
  context: Build an attractive, but safe, bike lane from the Theater to the Bike
    Store. Visit the river and give the Minister a surprise!
