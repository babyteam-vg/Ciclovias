  - Oh, finally, new faces are arriving in this city. Nice to meet you, I'm the Bishop
    of the city,
  - I couldn't help but notice the good works you've accomplished in the short time
    you've been here.
  - 'For that reason, God has entrusted me to give you the following task: build
    a safe and charming route from the Church to the Local Park, son.'
  - It would do our brothers good to breathe some fresh air. I'm sure their tithes
    will pay for the costs of the material.
  context: Build a safe and charming bike lane from the Church to the Local Park
    so that parishioners can breathe fresh air.
