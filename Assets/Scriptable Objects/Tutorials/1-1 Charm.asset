    - Hello again... The Municipality has asked me to instruct you on a new factor
      to take into account for the bike lanes you build.
    - 'In the Mayor own words: <i>"Cyclists cannot rely solely on safe bike lanes,
      we must give them an incentive to use them."</i>'
    - <i>"A charming route can be the differentiating factor we need so that people
      choose to travel by bike instead of by car."</i>
    - In short, a charming<sprite=0> route includes a percentage of charming areas
      visited, such as parks or rivers. Give it a try...

    - Charm, as well as safety, are percentage criteria...
    - That means the shortest the bike line, the most influence crossing a park will
      have on your charm.
    - Shorten the bike lane to increase the charm percentage...
